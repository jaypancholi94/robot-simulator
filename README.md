Welcome to the Robot Simulation project! 🚀 This project simulates a robot navigating a 5x5 grid, with a user-friendly interface built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook. It features navigation buttons at the bottom of the grid to control the robot's movements. You can also control the robot using arrow keys and Vim motion keys (h, j, k, l). The project is managed using the Bun package manager.

💡 **Fun Fact**: The first iteration of this project was a file named `robot.html`, which used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a canvas. It was a simpler implementation and laid the foundation for the more advanced React-based version you see today!
